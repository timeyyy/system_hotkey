System Hotkeys

'Multiplatform system wide hotkeys for python 3, no python2 support'

Atm support x11 and windows. Osx support is coming in a few years i would say!

------------
Installation
------------

the old "pip3 install system_hotkeys" should do the trick

^^^^^^^
Windows
^^^^^^^

also install pywin32

^^^^^^
Linux
^^^^^^^

For x11 you will should probably use the xcffib library, you will need the xcb bindings (bsd license) installed to use it (i think???)
Also supported is the python xlib bindings (gpl license
